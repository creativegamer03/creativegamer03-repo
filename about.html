        <hr/>
        <p align="justify">This site was created for the sole purpose of being an online personal file deposit site for me, CreativeGamer03. I might change this in the future, or make use of the current style. I don't know what I'll do next, other than just adding these weird stuff I created from stuff I've seen in Discord. Anyways, this site, currently, is just very early and doesn't have much function.<br/><br/></p>
