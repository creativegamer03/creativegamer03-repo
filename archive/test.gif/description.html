        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr/>
        This was created shortly after I came across a "gif video" in #memes. The link to it is: <a href="https://archuser.de/the-rock.gif">https://archuser.de/the-rock.gif</a><br/>
        Curious on how it works, I posted this in r/discordapp for answers, and I did get them in less than an hour. Here's the link to the reddit post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/u96kky/someone_sent_this_in_the_memes_channel_and_bruh/">Someone sent this in the memes channel and bruh... HOW?? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!</a>.<br/>

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        To use this, copy the following link and post this in a discord text channel. It will work its magic, due to the top comment in the reddit post.<br/>
